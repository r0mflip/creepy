By visiting any website various amounts of data can be obtained by a site without any
user concent. This data can then be used for targetting ads or tracking. Advanced
techniques, like ones used in [panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org) can
effeciently track users by using various standard and non standard APIs.

2. System languages
3. Screen size and specifications
4. Touch capabilities

10. User Agent string testing
